Riker is a [Pine64 Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/) with NixOS installed using a fairly standard [UEFI Install](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-manual), regular guides should be able to help. General paths follow the same as [donnager](../donnager/README.md), so reference that as needed.
