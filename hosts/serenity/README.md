Serenity is a [Pine64 Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/) who currently has a borked screen, will get a guide up at some point, but this is a fairly standard [UEFI Install](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-manual) of NixOS, regular guides should be able to help. General paths follow the same as [donnager](../donnager/README.md), so reference that as needed.
